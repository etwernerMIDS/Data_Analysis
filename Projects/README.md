* [Alliance Analysis](https://github.com/etwernerMIDS/Data_Analysis/tree/master/Projects/Alliance_Analysis)

The main focus of Alliance Analysis is to use data science and visualizations to better understand the development and organization of international alliances. Military alliances are strategic partnerships that ensure mutual protection and support in a time of conflict. Data analysis can help us better understand these relationships and even predict future beneficial ones.

* [Car Analysis](https://github.com/etwernerMIDS/Data_Analysis/tree/master/Projects/Car_Analysis)

The main focus of Car Analysis is to answer various buisness questions in regards to reselling used cars, specifically Porches. The analysis includes general data exploration with tables and graphs, which allow for useful buiness insights to be made. 

* [KMeans Analysis](https://github.com/etwernerMIDS/Data_Analysis/tree/master/Projects/KMeans_Analysis)

The main focus of K-Mean Analysis is to build an unsupervised vehicle-type classifier. This machine learning classifier would then help to improve nuclear material detection in vehcicle cargo as it is scanned at border stations. Overall, this was accomplished by transforming the data into feature vectors, optimizing the number of clusters to use for the K-Means algorithm, and then labeling each cluster with it's respective vehicle type.

* [MNIST Analysis](https://github.com/etwernerMIDS/Data_Analysis/tree/master/Projects/MNIST_Analysis)

The main focus of MNIST Analysis is construct a convolution neural net that would accuractly determine the handwritten-digit input. A comparison of several different CNNs was done, each with a different number of levels. As a result, a 4-layer CNN using stochastic Gradient Descent proved to have the best performance with 96% accuracy.

* [March Madness Analysis](https://github.com/etwernerMIDS/Data_Analysis/tree/master/Projects/March_Madness_Analysis)

The main focus of March Madness Analysis is 

* [Parse SOAP](https://github.com/etwernerMIDS/Data_Analysis/tree/master/Projects/Parse_SOAP)

The main focus of Parse SOAP is 

*All of these projects were completed from 2018-2019. These were completed using Python Jupyter Notebooks or RStudio.*
