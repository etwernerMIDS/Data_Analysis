# Alliance Analysis

## Erin Werner

The countries within a given military alliance are not random or arbitrary, but are deliberate in order to provide the greatest benefit for the cause. This means that each country must contribute a military arsenal that would serve as an advantage over the opposing alliance, thus dictating the distribution of military capabilities. This repoistory contains a model that reflects this alliance structure.

More specifically, in this repository you will find:

* a [Visualizations](https://github.com/etwernerMIDS/Data_Analysis/tree/master/Projects/Alliance_Analysis/Visualizations) folder

These are resulting outputs from code written with intention of better understanding alliances through data analysis. Each visualization helps to more easily understand the complex relationship between states in relation to their status in an alliance. 

* an [Overall Report](https://github.com/etwernerMIDS/Data_Analysis/blob/master/Projects/Alliance_Analysis/Math_111A_Final_Report_Erin_W.pdf)

This is a written report that details the motivation behind this project and repository. It includes an in-depth analysis of the military alliance structure as well as the visualizations that act as evidence to support this argument.

* two example R code files

These files include functions that produced some of the visualizations included in this project and repository.

*These projects were completed for the Center for Peace and Security Studies (CPASS) and UCSD's Math 111A Course - Mathematical Modeling I. These were completed using RStudio and the Tidyverse ggplot2 visualization library.*
