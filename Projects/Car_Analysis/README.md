# Car Analysis

## Erin Werner

Statistical analysis plays an important role in the buisness decision making process. Here, data about used cars, specifically Porches, can be used in order to derieve useful insights.

More specifically, in this repository you will find:

* an [Overall Report](https://github.com/etwernerMIDS/Data_Analysis/blob/master/Projects/Alliance_Analysis/Math_111A_Final_Report_Erin_W.pdf)

This is a written report that details the motivation behind this project and repository. It includes an in-depth analysis of the military alliance structure as well as the visualizations that act as evidence to support this argument.

* two example .R code files

These files include functions that produced some of the visualizations included in this project and repository.

*These projects were completed for a personal project. These were completed using RStudio and the Tidyverse ggplot2 visualization library.*
