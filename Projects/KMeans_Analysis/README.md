# K-Means Clustering Analysis

## Erin Werner

Vehicle-specific models help to account for shielding of natural background radiation at nuclear material detection stations. Picking the right vehicle model, through methods like vehicle classification, help to better classify scans. Vehicle classification can be achieved through forming feature vectors, running cluster analysis, and then building a vehicle classifier. This classifier will consequently make detection sensors better at distinguishing the threating from non-threating material found in cargo. This will then reduce the number of false alarms and make the detection process more accurate and efficient.

More specifically, in this repository you will find:

* a [Poster Presentaion](https://github.com/etwernerMIDS/Data_Analysis/blob/master/Projects/KMeans_Analysis/Erin_Poster.pptx)

This is a poster presenation report that details the motivation behind this project and repository. It includes an overview of the steps taken throughout the process as well as an in-depth analysis of the resulting unsupervised vehicle-type classifier. This poster was presented at the American Nuclear Society Conference in 2019.

* three example .py code files

These files include functions that produced some of the results included in this project and repository.

*This project was completed for the Lawerence Livermore National Laboratory - NSA DNDO Summer Internship Program (2018). These were completed using Python and the respective SciKit Learn libraries.*
