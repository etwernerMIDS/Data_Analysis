# Alliance Analysis

## Erin Werner

The countries within a given military alliance are not random or arbitrary, but are deliberate in order to provide the greatest benefit for the cause. This means that each country must contribute a military arsenal that would serve as an advantage over the opposing alliance, thus dictating the distribution of military capabilities. This repoistory contains a model that reflects this alliance structure.

More specifically, in this repository you will find:

* an [Overall Report](https://github.com/etwernerMIDS/Data_Analysis/blob/master/Projects/Alliance_Analysis/Math_111A_Final_Report_Erin_W.pdf)
* two example R code files
* a [Visualizations](https://github.com/etwernerMIDS/Data_Analysis/tree/master/Projects/Alliance_Analysis/Visualizations) folder

* These projects were completed for the Center for Peace and Security Studies (CPASS) think tank and UCSD's Math 111A - Mathematical Modeling I. These were completed using RStudio and the Tidyverse ggplot2 visualization library. *
