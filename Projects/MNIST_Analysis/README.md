# MNIST Analysis

## Erin Werner

The MNIST database is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The goal of this project is to classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9, inclusively. This can be achieved by building a Convolution Neural Net (CNN) and tuning the hyperparameters or increaseing the number layers in order to improve the model accuracy. An accuracy of 96% was achieved with a 4-layer CNN, using Stochastic Gradient Descent, ReLU, and Max Pooling.

More specifically, in this repository you will find:

* an [Overall Report](https://github.com/etwernerMIDS/Data_Analysis/blob/master/Projects/MNIST_Analysis/CSE_151_MNIST_CNN.pdf)

This is a written report that details the motivation behind this project and repository. It includes an in-depth analysis of the various Convolution Neural Nets and their classifiction results in regards to the hand-written digit inputs.

* a [Python Notebook](https://github.com/etwernerMIDS/Data_Analysis/blob/master/Projects/MNIST_Analysis/CSE%20151%20Final%20Project.ipynb)

This code file includes all the steps that were taken to build and compare the various CNNs, each with a different amount of layers.

*This project was completed for UCSD's Computer Science and Engineering 151A Course - Introduction to Machine Learning. These were completed using Python and the PyTorch libraries.*
