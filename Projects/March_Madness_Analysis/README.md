# March Madness Analysis

## Erin Werner

Each season there are thousands of NCAAÂ® basketball games played between Division I women's teams, culminating in March Madness, which is the 64-team national championship that starts in the middle of March. The goal of this project is to use statistical methods to test and train a model on the NCAA historical tournament results dataset and then predict the results of the incoming 2019 March Madness tournament. In this context, seeding will be used to predict the winner through logistic regression.

More specifically, in this repository you will find:

* an [Overall Report](https://github.com/etwernerMIDS/Data_Analysis/blob/master/Projects/March_Madness_Analysis/MarchMadnessAnalysis.pdf)

This is a written report that details the motivation behind this project and repository. It includes an in-depth analysis of the various statistical methods, such a linear regression, used in order to predict the winners of the tournament.

* a .R code file

This code file includes all the steps that were taken to build the logistic regression model and the resulting probability distribution.

*This project was completed for UCSD's Math 189 Course - Exploratory Data Analysis and Inference. These were completed using RStudio and the ggplot2 visualization library.*
